This is my proposed badge for bsidesIowa 2018. All engineering is a sliding scale of cost/functionality. At the top end I would like to propose a badge that uses the esp32 to create a piano. Optional features as I have time include using the built in bluetooth to embed a code in a blinking led to allow someone else to control your piano.
